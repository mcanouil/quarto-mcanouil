## Introduction

This document demonstrates various Quarto markdown elements to showcase the theming capabilities of Mickaël Canouil's brand extension.

## Typography and Text Formatting

### Basic Text Styling

Here's some **bold text**, *italic text*, and ***bold italic text***. You can also use `inline code` within paragraphs.

### Lists

#### Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item with **bold text**
- Third item with *italic text*
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
    - Deeply nested item

#### Ordered Lists

1. First numbered item
2. Second numbered item
3. Third numbered item with `code`
   a. Sub-item a
   b. Sub-item b
   c. Sub-item c

#### Task Lists

- [x] Completed task
- [ ] Incomplete task
- [x] Another completed task

## Code Blocks

```python
def fibonacci(n):
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence up to n terms."""
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    
    sequence = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        sequence.append(sequence[i-1] + sequence[i-2])
    
    return sequence #<1>

# Example usage
fib_numbers = fibonacci(10)
print(f"First 10 Fibonacci numbers: {fib_numbers}")
```

1. This comment highlights the return statement in the code above.

## Quotes and Callouts

### Blockquotes

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
> 
> — Alan Kay

> This is a longer blockquote that spans multiple lines to demonstrate
> how the brand theming affects quote styling. It includes various
> formatting elements like **bold text** and *italic text*.

### Callouts

::: {.callout-note}
This is a note callout. Use it to highlight important information that readers should pay attention to.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
This is a warning callout. Use it to alert readers about potential issues or important considerations.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
This is a tip callout. Use it to provide helpful suggestions or best practices.
:::

::: {.callout-important}
This is an important callout. Use it for critical information that must not be overlooked.
:::

::: {.callout-caution}
This is a caution callout. Use it to warn about potential risks or problems.
:::

## Tables

### Simple Table

| Feature | HTML | Typst | Reveal.js |
|---------|------|-------|-----------|
| Typography | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Colors | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Layout | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Interactive | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |

### Complex Table

| Language | Paradigm | Year | Key Features |
|----------|----------|------|--------------|
| Python | Multi-paradigm | 1991 | Simple syntax, extensive libraries |
| R | Functional, procedural | 1993 | Statistical computing, data analysis |
| JavaScript | Multi-paradigm | 1995 | Web development, event-driven |
| Rust | Systems | 2010 | Memory safety, performance |

## Mathematical Expressions

### Inline Mathematics

The quadratic formula is $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ and Euler's identity states that $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.

### Display Mathematics

The probability density function of a normal distribution is:

$$
f(x|\mu,\sigma^2) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

A system of linear equations can be represented as:

$$\begin{align}
ax + by &= c \\
dx + ey &= f
\end{align}$$

## Figures and Images

![]({{< placeholder 600 400 format=png >}})

This is a placeholder for an image that would showcase how the brand theming affects figure styling. In a real document, you would include actual images here.

## Conclusion

This document demonstrates various Quarto markdown elements that benefit from the brand theming provided by this extension. The theming affects:

- **Typography**: Font choices, sizes, and spacing
- **Colours**: Text, backgrounds, and accent colours
- **Layout**: Margins, padding, and structural elements
- **Code**: Syntax highlighting and code block styling
- **Tables**: Borders, backgrounds, and formatting
- **Callouts**: Background colors and styling
- **Mathematical expressions**: Font and styling
- **Links**: Colours and hover effects

The brand extension ensures consistent visual identity across all supported output formats (HTML, Typst, and Reveal.js).
